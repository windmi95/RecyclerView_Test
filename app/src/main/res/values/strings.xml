\nMcLaughlin, the reigning Olympic champion, was the red-hot favourite and absolutely smashed her own world record by nearly a second in the final on Saturday in Eugene, Oregon.\n

\nThe incredible time chopped nearly a full second off her previous mark of 51.41, set at last yearâ€™s Tokyo Olympics.</string>
